Please see the included compiled help for documentation on the Ingres ASP.NET Role and Membership 
Providers.

For more information on ASP.NET Providers please see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa530801.aspx

The Ingres ASP.NET Role and Membership Providers are based closely upon the Microsoft / SQL Server 
implementation. The same encryption and hashing methods are used. Consequently, it should be a
relatively simple task to port an existing ASP.NET application using Roles / Membership and the SQL
Server provider to the Ingres database.

The Microsoft Provider toolkit was used for reference purposes and is available at the following URL:

The documentation for the the provider functionality is based upon the MSDN documentation.

The Ingres ASP.NET Role and Membership Providers utilise the DBUtil helper class which was written 
by Les Benson and is (c) Luminary Solutions Limited.
