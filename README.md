# Ingres .NET Roles and Membership Providers
Roles and Membership providers for the Ingres database that I wrote back in 2008. 

## Notes
- They were based on the SQL Server reference implementation.
- They were written when only positional parameters were supported in the Ingres .NET data provider. Support for named parameters has since been added.
- In retrospect, I perhaps added too many comments!
- These providers should work with Actian Vectorwise, although I haven't tested this.
- I no longer work with the Ingres database, so I probably won't be updating these providers any time soon.
